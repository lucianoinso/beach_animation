# Procedural beach animation using Processing
## Usage
Open _beach.pde_ file with [Processing](https://processing.org/), click the _Run_ button, lie back and enjoy, headphones recommended for a more immersive experience.

> When first open, *Processing* will create a _Sketch_ (project) inside a new directory but it will only put the beach.pde file inside, be sure to move the beach.wav file into the new directory.
